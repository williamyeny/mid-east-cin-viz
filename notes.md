## Bab'Aziz

Gorgeously photographed (though the magnificently barren landscapes on display could hardly come across any other way) by Mahmoud Kalari, "Bab'Aziz" fairly demands to be experienced on the big screen.

"Bab'Aziz" was shot mostly in parched Iranian landscapes; the film’s brilliant cinematographer, Mahmoud Kalari, frames the dunes, rock formations and sandblasted village and cities with a poet’s eye, turning real spaces into dreamscapes.
