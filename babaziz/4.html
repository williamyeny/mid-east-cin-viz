      <h2>Candle flame</h2>
      <p>"The people of this world are like the three butterflies in front of a candle's flame</p>
      <p>The first one went closer and said: 'I know about love.'</p>
      <p>The second one touched the flame lightly with his wings and said 'I know how love's fire can burn.'</p>
      <p>The third one threw himself into the heart of the flame and was consumed.</p>
      <p>He alone knows what true love is."</p>
